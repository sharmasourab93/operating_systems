# I/O Management

Operating system

- Has protocols 
	- Interfaces for device I/O
- Has dedicated handlers
	- Device drivers, interrupt handlers
- Decouple I/O details from core processing
	- abstract I/O device detail from applications
    
## I/O Device Features

- Control registers (accessed by CPU)
	- Command
    - Data Transfers
    - Status
- Microcontroller : device's CPU
- On device memory
- Other logic
	- e.g. analog to digital
    
## Device drivers

- per each device type
- responsible for device access management and control
- provided by device manufacturers per OS /version
- each OS standardizes interfaces
	- device independence
    - device diversity

## Types of devices

- Block
	- e.g. disk
    - read/write blocks of data
    - direct access to arbitrary block
- Character
	- e.g. keyboard
    - get/put character
- Network devices

OS representation of a device : special device file

UNIX like systems:

* /dev
* tmpfs
* devfs

Linux supports a number of pseudo "virtual" devices that provide special functionality to a system.

## CPU device interactions

![iointeractions.png](../images/iointeractions.png)

access device registers : memory load/store

1. Memory mapped I/0
	- part of 'host' physical memory dedicated for device interactions
    - Base Address Registers (BAR)
2. I/O Port
	- dedicated in low instructions for device access
    - target device (I/0 port) and value in register
    
## Path from Device to CPU

1. Interrupt
	- Overhead: Interrupt handling steps
    - \+: Can be generated as soon as possible
2. Polling
	- Overhead: Delay or CPU overhead
    - when convenient for OS
    
## Device access : Programmed I/O (PIO)    

- No additional hardware support
- CPU "programs" the device
	- via command registers
    - data movement
- E.g. NIC(Network Interface Card)
	- data = network packet
- Write command to request packet information
- Copy packet to data registers
- Repeat until packet sent

E.g. 1500B packet; 8 byte registers or bus => 1(for bus command) + 188(for data) = 189 CPU store instructions

## Direct Memory Access (DMA)

- Relies on DMA controller
- CPU "programs" the device
	- via command registers
    - via DMA controls
- E.g. NIC (data = network packet)
- Write command to request packet information
- Configure DMA controller with in memory address and size of packet buffer

E.g. 1500B packet; 8 byte registers or bus => 1(for bus command) + 1(for DMA configuration) = total 2 CPU store instructions. Less steps, but DMA configuration is more complex.

For DMAs
- data buffer must be in physical memory until transfer completes
- pinning regions (non-swappable)

## Typical Device Access

![typicaldeviceaccess.png](../images/typicaldeviceaccess.png)

- System call
- In-kernel stack
- Driver Invocation
- Device request configuration
- Device performs request

### OS bypass

![osbypass.png](../images/osbypass.png)

- device registers/data
	- directly available
- OS configures
	- then gets out of the way
- "user level driver"
	- in library
- OS retains coarse-grain control
- relies on device features
	- sufficient registers
    - demux capability

## What happens to a calling thread?

![access.png](../images/access.png)

* Synchronous I/O operations
	- process blocks
* Asynchronous I/O operations
	- process continues
    - Later, process checks and retrieves result
    - OR
    - process is notified that operation is completed and results are ready
    
## Block Device Stack

Block device typical storage for files:

![blockdevicestack.png](../images/blockdevicestack.png)

- processes use files => logical storage unit
- kernel file system (KFS)
	- where how to find and access file
    - OS specifies interface
- generic block layer
	- OS standardized block interface
- Device driver    

## Virtual File System

![vfs.png](../images/vfs.png)

### Virtual File System Abstractions

* File : Elements on which the VFS operates
* File Descriptor : OS representation of file
	- open, read, write, send file , lock, close
* inode : Persistent representation of file "index"
	- list of all data blocks
    - device, permissions, size
* dentry : Directory entry, corresponding to the single path component, 
	- dentry cache
* super block : file system specific information regarding the File System layout

### VFS on disk

* File : data blocks on disk
* inode : track file blocks
	- also resides on disk in some block
* super block : overall map of disk blocks
	- inode blocks
    - data blocks
    - free blocks

### Inodes

Index of all disk blocks corresponding to a file

* File : identified by inode
* inode : list of all blocks + other metadata

**\+**: Easy to perform sequential or random access<br>
**\-**: Limit on file size

### Inodes with indirect pointers

* Index of all disk blocks corresponding to a file
* Index contain:
	- metadata
    - pointers to blocks
* Direct pointer : Points to data block
	- 1 KB per entry
* Indirect pointer : Points to block of pointers
	- 256 KB per entry    
* Double Indirect pointer : Points to block of block of pointers
	- 64 MB per entry    
    
**\+**: Small inode => large file size<br>
**\-**: File access slowdown

## Disk access optimizations 

Reducing file access overheads

1. Caching/buffering : reducenumber of disk accesses
	- buffer cache in main menu
    - read/write from cache
    - periodically flush to disk - fsync()
2. I/O scheduling : reduce disk head movement
	- maximize sequential vs random access
3. Prefetching : increases cache hits
	- leverages locality
4. Journaling/logging: reduce random access (ext3, ext4)
	- "describe" write in log : block, offset, value..
    - periodically apply updates to proper disk locations
