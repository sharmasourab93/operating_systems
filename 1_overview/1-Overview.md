# Operating Systems Overview

An Operating System performs all the basic tasks like managing file, process and memory. i.e. resource manager. 


**Operating Systems** :
- Direct operational resources [CPU, memory, devices]
- Enforces working policies [Resource usage, access]
- Mitigates difficulty of complex tasks [abstract hardware details (using system calls)]

## What is an Operating System?

* Intermediate between Hardware and Software applications
* Hides hardware complexity (Read/write file storage, send/receive socket network)
* Handles resource management (CPU scheduling, Memory management)
* Provide isolation and protection (allocate different parts of memory to different applications so that applications don't overwrite other memory locations)

## Operating System definition:

An **Operating System** is a layer of systems software that:
* directly has privileged access to the underlying hardware;
* hides the hardware complexity;
* manages hardware on behalf of one or more application according to some predifined policies.
* In addition, it ensures that applications are isolated and protected from one another.

## Operating System examples:

Desktop|Embedded devices
-----------|------------
Microsoft Windows | Android OS 
MAC OS X (BSD) | iOS
LINUX | Symbian

## OS Elements

- **Abstractions** (corresponds to applications that OS executes)
	- process, thread, file, socket,  memory page
- **Mechanisms**  (on top of Abstractions)
	- create, schedule, open, write, allocate
- **Policies** (how mechanisms are used to manage underlying hardware)    
	- Least Recently Used (LRU) , Earliest Deadline First (EDF), etc.
    
#### Example :

_Memory Management:_

- **Abstractions**: Memory page
- **Mechanisms**: Allocate, map to a process
- **Policies**: LRU

## OS Design Principles

- Seperation of mechanism and policy
	- implement flexible mechanisms to support many policies 
    - e.g. LRU, LFU, random
- Optimize for common case 
	- Where will the OS be used?
    - What will the user want to execute on that machine?
    - What are the workload requirements?
    
## User/ Kernel Protection Boundary

* user-level => applications [underprivileged mode]
* kernel-level => OS Kernel [privileged access, hardware access]

- User-Kernel switch is supported by hardware.
	- using trap instructions
    - system calls like:
    	- open (file)
        - send (socket)
        - malloc (memory)
	- signals
    
## System call Flowcart

![systemcallflowchart](../images/systemcallflowchart.png)
    
- To make a system call, an application must:
	- write arguments
    - save relevant data ast well defined location
    - make system calls using system call number
- In synchronous mode : wait until system call completes.

## Basic OS services

* process management
* file management
* device management
* memory management
* storage management
* security

## Linux System Calls

Task|Commands
------------ | ------------
Process Control | fork (); exit(); wait(); 
File Manipulation | open(); read(); write();
Device Manipulation | ioctl(); read(); write();
Information Maintenance | getpid(); alarm(); sleep();
Communication | pipe(); shmget(); mmap();
Protection | chmod(); umask(); chown();
